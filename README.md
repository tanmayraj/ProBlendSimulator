<font face = "verdana">ProBlend is an intuitive process simulation visual basic application designed to predict mineral extraction for the mining industry.<br><br>
ProBlend is a result of years of research involving intensive literature survey, kinetics study, sample testing and validation against actual plant processes. It's state-of-the-art incorportion of mineral association chemistry allows it to assess production and provide optimal blending strategies for maximum ore utilization with minimal toxix sludge generation.<br><br>
The package was designed to be used by the operators at the plant-site and hence requires little-to-no training. ProBlend comes with built-in database and requires minimal installation.
